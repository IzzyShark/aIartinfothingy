So if you're reading this, you want to know what IZZY/KEKU (or what I'm currently nicknaming myself in Discord) is.
What I can do with AI art:
Oc's
Can make you your own OCs (Sonas or anime OCs).
NSFW
SFW
Furries
Anime
Single characters
Edit refs
Use references as a base.
Use images and load them into AI.
3D stuff
Simplistic
Realistic (to an extent)
edits to your ocs or references that you provide
Make new original OCs for you.
anime/furry: D
Robotic stuff
milfs
Protogens (sooooooooooorta, if you like protogens with weird yet artistic-looking visors, lol, but the visors are mostly kind of screwed up and protogens look like someone just painted some 80s art onto their visors, it looks cool though.)
And a lot more: (Basically, I can do 97% of what you ask.)
(If you're confused about something, feel free to DM me.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What I cannot do
2 OCs in 1 image
animations (Obviously)
Anything that is not anime or furry
(Blame the AI, lol.)
2 OCs of your fucking, cuddling, hugging, etc. I have tried my best with this, but I won't do it no matter what I fucking try. I apologize.
Things I won't do
Bestiality, cub, scat, fetish stuff, etc.
Why the fuck Novel-AI has this in the tag system is beyond me, and I've seen people on Reddit complaining about it, yet nothing has been done about it.
(If you ask for this, I'll block you or ban you if you're on my server.)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First things first, personally, I don't believe AI-ART to be stealing. Second of all, a lot of artists use references from other artists on Twitter, and the AI obviously needs to be fed or trained on how to do furry stuff and anime stuff. It's designed to make new things and, of course, be inaccurate, so don't shit your pants or feel like what you got made is not "original," as trust me, it very much is. So if anyone says to you, "Ai is stealing," tell them to fuck off.
Another thing: NO, I'M NOT EVER GOING TO FUCKING CHARGE PEOPLE FOR AI ART. Personally (again), I find it scummy, as AI can create art in 10â€“20 seconds flat. Also, I know many people can't easily afford commissions, and people on Twitter sometimes have stupid prices, like $400 for a stupid mid-quality sketch, and even cheap commissions are a lot to some people due to more unfortunate lifestyles and stuff.
Third thing: please don't fucking bombard me with requests. I'm happy to do ai art, but in the past I've had people give me like 20 things at once they want made, and it DOES get annoying, really fucking annoying, so don't bombard me with pings or DMs about tons of different things you want made.
Finally, I do this for fun and to make people happy. Again, not many people can afford to have their own OCs or sonas made from scratch, and I pay next to nothing to make this stuff for like 2 months as much as I want. Also, if I take a long time doing your request, it's because I'm busy, with friends, or doing something else, so don't ping me about your request because I'll just ignore it and prolong it on purpose.
