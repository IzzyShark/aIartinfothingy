So If you're reading this, you want to what IZZY/KEKU (or what im currently nicknaming myself in discord)

What i can do with ai art : D

Oc's

Can make you your own OC's (Sonas or anime oc's : 3 )

NSFW

SFW

Furries

Anime

Single characters

Edit refs

Use refs as a base.

Use images and load them into ai 

3D stuff

Simplistic

Realistic (to an extent)

edits of your oc's/refs you give me

Make new original oc's for you 

anime/furry : D

Robotic stuff

milfs

Protogens (sooooooooooorta, if you like protogens with weird yet artistic looking visors lol, but the visors are mostly kinda screweed up and protogens look like someone just painted some 80s art onto their visors, looks cool though : D)

And a lot more : D (basically i can do 97% of waht you ask )

(If you're confused about soemthing feel free to dm me)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What i cannot do

2 oc's in 1 image

animations (Obviously)

Anything that is NOT Anime/Furry 

(Blame the ai lol)

2 oc's of urs fucking, cuddling, hugging etc, i Have tried my best with this but ai won't do it no matter what i fucking try,  I apologse

Things i won't do

Bestiality, cub, scat, fetish stuff, etc, 

Why the fuck NOVEL-AI has this in the tag system is fucking beyond me and i've seen  people on reddit complaining about it yet nothing has been done about it.

(if you ask for this i'll block you or ban you if you're in my server)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now first thing - Personally i don't believe AI-ART to be stealing, 2nd of all a lot of artsists use reference from other artsists on twitter and the ai obviously needs to be fed/trained on how to do furry stuff and anime stuff, its designed to make new things and of course be inaccuarate so don't shit your pants or feel like what you got made is not "original" as trust me it very much is so if anyone says to you "ai is stealing" tell them to fuck off lol. 

Another thing -  NO IM NOT EVER GOING TO FUCKING CHARGE PEOPLE FOR AI ART,  personally (again) i find it scummy as ai can create art in 10-20 seconds flat, Also I know many people can't easily afford comissions and people on twitter sometimes have stupid prices, shit like $400 for a stupid mid quality sketch and even cheap comissions are a lot to some people due to more unfortunate lifestyles and stuff.

3rd thing - please don't fucking bombard me with requests, im happy to do ai art but in the past i've had people give me like 20 things at once they want made and it DOES get annoying, really fucking annoying actually, so don't bombared me with pings/dms about tons of different things you want made.

Finally, I do this for fun and to make people happy, Again not many people can afford to have their own ocs/sonas made from scratch and myself pays next to nothing to make this stuff for like 2 months as much as i want, Also if i take long doing your request then its because im busy, with friends or doing something so don't ping me about your request because i'll just ignore it and prolong it on purpose SO BE FUCKING PATIENT
